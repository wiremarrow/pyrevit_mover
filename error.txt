Transform Matrix:



BasisX: (0.0000, 1.0000, 0.0000)



BasisY: (-1.0000, 0.0000, 0.0000)



BasisZ: (0.0000, 0.0000, 1.0000)



Rotation angle from BasisX: 90.00 degrees



Rotation angle from BasisY: 90.00 degrees




Unit vector transformations:



X(1,0,0) -> (0.0000, 1.0000, 0.0000)



Y(0,1,0) -> (-1.0000, 0.0000, 0.0000)




Transform is invertible: True



Transform determinant: 1.0



Is translation only: False

=== STARTING VIEW UPDATES ===



=== V3 ELEVATION MARKER TEST - NO TRANSFORMATION ===



TESTING: Skipping all elevation marker transformations to see if they follow building automatically



Found 44 total elevation elements - SKIPPING ALL TRANSFORMATIONS



Hypothesis: Elevation markers should align automatically with transformed building



=== ELEVATION MARKER TEST COMPLETE ===



NO transformations applied - testing if markers follow building automatically



Expected result: Markers should be properly aligned if hypothesis is correct
