# PyRevit Extension - Field House Placement Fix

This repository contains PyRevit scripts to fix the placement of a field house in a middle school construction project.

## Problem
The contracted architect delivered the field house .rvt file with the building placed in a random corner of the site plan instead of its designated location.

## Solution
Using PyRevit scripts to programmatically move and align the field house to its correct position without relying on Shared Coordinates.

## Setup
1. Install PyRevit on the Windows machine with Revit
2. Clone this repository
3. Load scripts through PyRevit extension manager or run directly

## Development Workflow
- Develop scripts on macOS using Claude Code
- Push changes to GitHub
- Pull on Windows machine with Revit
- Execute scripts and commit results/errors
- Pull results back on macOS for debugging
